# Configuration

Snablr can be configured with:

- built-in defaults
- a YAML config file
- CLI flags

The default runtime config file is:

- `configs/config.yaml`

Example profiles live under:

- `examples/config.basic.yaml`
- `examples/config.domain.yaml`
- `examples/config.targeted.yaml`
- `examples/config.production.yaml`

## Configuration Precedence

Snablr applies configuration in this order:

1. built-in defaults
2. YAML config file
3. CLI flags

CLI flags always win for the current run.

Example:

```bash
snablr scan \
  --config examples/config.domain.yaml \
  --share SYSVOL \
  --max-scan-time 30m
```

In that example:

- the YAML file provides the base config
- `--share` overrides the configured share list
- `--max-scan-time` overrides the configured time limit

## Top-Level Sections

The config file is grouped into:

- `app`
- `scan`
- `archives`
- `sqlite`
- `suppression`
- `rules`
- `output`

## `app`

Example:

```yaml
app:
  name: snablr
  log_level: info
  banner_path: internal/ui/assets/snablr.txt
```

Fields:

- `name`
  Display name used by the application. This should normally remain `snablr`.
- `log_level`
  Logging verbosity. Typical values are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`.
- `banner_path`
  Runtime path to the ASCII banner asset.

## `scan`

The `scan` section controls target selection, discovery, scope filtering, performance, and runtime behavior.

### Targets

- `targets`
  Explicit list of hosts to scan.
- `targets_file`
  Path to a file containing one target per line.

Behavior:

- if `targets` or `targets_file` is set, Snablr uses those targets
- if both are empty, Snablr attempts LDAP discovery unless disabled

### Credentials

- `username`
  SMB and LDAP username. Required for SMB when `smb_auth` is `ntlm`.
- `password`
  SMB and LDAP password. Required for SMB when `smb_auth` is `ntlm`.
- `smb_auth`
  SMB authentication method: `ntlm` or `kerberos`
- `smb_ccache`
  Optional path to a FILE Kerberos credential cache for `smb_auth: kerberos`; if empty, Snablr uses `KRB5CCNAME` or `/tmp/krb5cc_<uid>`

Committed configs should use placeholders, not real secrets.

Typical override pattern:

```bash
snablr scan --config examples/config.domain.yaml --user 'DOMAIN\user' --pass 'REPLACE_ME'
```

Kerberos ccache pattern:

```bash
KRB5_CONFIG=/etc/krb5.conf snablr scan --targets fileserver.example.local --smb-auth kerberos --smb-ccache /tmp/krb5cc_1000 --no-ldap
```

### LDAP Discovery

- `no_ldap`
  Disable LDAP discovery
- `domain`
  Manual domain override
- `dc`
  Manual domain controller override
- `base_dn`
  Manual LDAP search base override
- `ldap_auth`
  LDAP bind method: `auto`, `simple`, `ntlm`, or `gssapi`
- `ldap_transport`
  LDAP transport: `auto`, `ldap`, or `ldaps`
- `discover_dfs`
  Enable DFS discovery so linked shares can be added to the pipeline

How LDAP discovery works:

1. Snablr checks for explicit targets
2. if none are present, it tries to detect domain context
3. it finds a domain controller or uses `dc`
4. it connects with `ldap_transport` (`auto` starts with LDAP unless `dc` uses `ldaps://` or port `636`)
5. it binds with `ldap_auth` (`auto` keeps the existing simple-bind behavior)
6. if an automatic LDAP bind reports stronger-authentication or signing requirements, it retries over LDAPS
7. it queries LDAP for computer objects
8. it merges those discovered hosts into the target pipeline

Notes:

- use `ldap_transport: ldaps` or `--ldap-transport ldaps` in environments where port `389` is blocked or policy requires TLS from the first packet
- `ldap_auth: gssapi` uses Windows SSPI on Windows and Kerberos via gokrb5 on Linux/non-Windows; over LDAPS it includes a TLS server-endpoint channel binding token
- plain `ldap://389` GSSAPI signing is not implemented because go-ldap does not expose SASL security-layer wrapping for LDAP messages after bind; use LDAPS when signing policy requires integrity
- `ldap_auth: ntlm` uses the go-ldap NTLM bind path, which does not provide LDAP signing on port `389` or LDAPS channel binding; use it only where those policies are not enforced
- the automatic fallback is transport-level only; it does not switch to GSSAPI automatically
- logs indicate which LDAP method was used so discovery behavior stays transparent during troubleshooting

### Share And Path Filters

- `share`
  Only scan these share names
- `exclude_share`
  Skip these share names
- `path`
  Only scan files under these share-relative path prefixes
- `exclude_path`
  Skip files under these path prefixes
- `max_depth`
  Maximum recursion depth during share walking

These filters are applied early during share selection and file walking so they reduce work before file scanning starts.

### Reachability

- `skip_reachability_check`
  Skip TCP `445` reachability testing
- `reachability_timeout_seconds`
  Timeout for SMB reachability checks
- `smb_operation_timeout_seconds`
  Timeout for SMB metadata operations such as share listing, mounting, and directory walking. If a host times out during these operations, Snablr skips the rest of that host and continues with the next target.

Recommended default:
- keep reachability enabled for larger scans to reduce wasted SMB connection attempts

### Planning

- `prioritize_ad_shares`
  Give extra planning priority to `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON`
- `only_ad_shares`
  Restrict scanning to `SYSVOL` and `NETLOGON`

### Performance

- `worker_count`
  Number of file scanning workers

Special behavior:
- `0` means adaptive worker scaling

- `max_file_size`
  Maximum file size Snablr will consider for scanning

Larger values increase coverage but also increase I/O and memory pressure.

### Runtime Control

- `profile`
  Explicit scan profile. Supported values are `default`, `validation`, and `aggressive`.

- `baseline`
  Path to a previous JSON result used for comparison during the current scan
- `seed_manifest`
  Path to a seeder manifest JSON file so the report can include seeded expected-versus-observed validation
- `validation_mode`
  Enable extra diagnostic tracking for skipped files, suppressed findings, downgraded findings, and validation metrics
- `max_scan_time`
  Maximum total scan time, for example `30m` or `2h`
- `checkpoint_file`
  Path to the checkpoint JSON file
- `resume`
  Resume from a previous checkpoint

Resume behavior:

- file completion is keyed by path plus file metadata
- resumed scans reprocess files whose size or modified timestamp changed
- this avoids the earlier path-only skip behavior for changed files without adding heavy content hashing by default

### Scan Profiles

Profiles set predictable bounded-inspection behavior without requiring many ad hoc flags.

- `default`
  Balanced production profile. Recommended for everyday live-environment scans.
- `validation`
  Conservative review-oriented profile. Uses tighter archive and SQLite limits and enables validation diagnostics.
- `aggressive`
  Broader bounded-inspection profile. Still local-side and bounded, but allows larger archive and SQLite inspection limits.

Profile notes:

- profiles only tune existing bounded-inspection and diagnostics settings
- they do not add new detection families
- CLI flags still override the active profile for the current run
- the selected profile is recorded in console, JSON, and HTML output

## `archives`

The `archives` section controls limited archive inspection.

Phase 1 support is intentionally narrow:

- `.zip`
- `.tar`
- `.tar.gz`
- `.tgz`
- local in-process inspection using Go stdlib
- no nested archive traversal
- no password-protected archive support
- no extraction to disk during normal scanning

Example:

```yaml
archives:
  enabled: true
  auto_zip_max_size: 10485760
  allow_large_zips: false
  max_zip_size: 10485760
  auto_tar_max_size: 10485760
  allow_large_tars: false
  max_tar_size: 10485760
  max_members: 64
  max_member_bytes: 524288
  max_total_uncompressed_bytes: 4194304
  inspect_extensionless_text: true
```

Fields:

- `enabled`
  Enable limited `.zip` inspection.
- `auto_zip_max_size`
  Automatically inspect `.zip` files up to this size in bytes. Default: `10485760` (10 MB).
- `allow_large_zips`
  Permit `.zip` inspection above the automatic limit when `max_zip_size` allows it.
- `max_zip_size`
  Absolute maximum `.zip` size Snablr will inspect when large-zip inspection is enabled.
- `auto_tar_max_size`
  Automatically inspect `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, and `.tgz` files up to this size in bytes. Default: `10485760` (10 MB).
- `allow_large_tars`
  Permit tar-based archive inspection above the automatic limit when `max_tar_size` allows it.
- `max_tar_size`
  Absolute maximum tar-based archive size Snablr will inspect when larger tar inspection is enabled.
- `max_members`
  Maximum number of archive members inspected per supported archive.
- `max_member_bytes`
  Maximum uncompressed bytes read from any single member.
- `max_total_uncompressed_bytes`
  Maximum total uncompressed bytes read across inspected members in one archive.
- `inspect_extensionless_text`
  Inspect extensionless members when they look text-like.

Behavior:

- `.zip` files above the automatic limit are skipped by default
- tar-based archives above the automatic limit are skipped by default
- `.rar`, `.7z`, and similar formats remain skipped by default
- only text-like members are inspected
- nested archives are skipped
- remote scans never unpack archives on the target side; the outer file is read and inspected locally
- archive findings are reported with both the outer archive path and inner member path

## `wim`

The `wim` section controls limited offline WIM inspection.

Phase 1 support is intentionally narrow:

- `.wim` candidates only
- local inspection only after the outer file is copied/read locally
- targeted extraction only for selected deployment and credential-relevant paths
- no full image extraction

Example:

```yaml
wim:
  enabled: true
  auto_wim_max_size: 134217728
  allow_large_wims: false
  max_wim_size: 134217728
  max_members: 8
  max_member_bytes: 1048576
  max_total_bytes: 4194304
```

Fields:

- `enabled`
  Enable bounded `.wim` inspection.
- `auto_wim_max_size`
  Automatically inspect `.wim` files up to this size in bytes.
- `allow_large_wims`
  Permit `.wim` inspection above the automatic limit when `max_wim_size` allows it.
- `max_wim_size`
  Absolute maximum `.wim` size Snablr will inspect.
- `max_members`
  Maximum number of targeted WIM members extracted for inspection.
- `max_member_bytes`
  Maximum bytes read from any single extracted WIM member.
- `max_total_bytes`
  Maximum total extracted bytes read across one WIM image.

CLI note:

- `snablr scan` also accepts `--wim-*` flags for all of these values
- explicit CLI WIM flags override config values for that run only

## `sqlite`

The `sqlite` section controls limited offline SQLite inspection.

Phase 1 support is intentionally narrow:

- `.sqlite`, `.sqlite3`, `.db`, and `.db3` candidates only
- SQLite header validation before inspection
- local read-only inspection only
- bounded schema and row sampling
- no live DB access
- no full-database dumping

Example:

```yaml
sqlite:
  enabled: true
  auto_db_max_size: 5242880
  allow_large_dbs: false
  max_db_size: 5242880
  max_tables: 8
  max_rows_per_table: 5
  max_cell_bytes: 256
  max_total_bytes: 16384
  max_interesting_columns: 4
```

Fields:

- `enabled`
  Turn SQLite inspection on or off.
- `auto_db_max_size`
  SQLite files at or below this size are inspected automatically.
- `allow_large_dbs`
  Allow inspection above the automatic limit when `max_db_size` is set high enough.
- `max_db_size`
  Absolute SQLite file size ceiling for inspection.
- `max_tables`
  Maximum number of interesting tables sampled from one database.
- `max_rows_per_table`
  Maximum number of sampled rows per interesting table.
- `max_cell_bytes`
  Maximum bytes read from one interesting cell value.
- `max_total_bytes`
  Maximum total bytes processed across all sampled SQLite cell values in one database.
- `max_interesting_columns`
  Maximum number of high-signal columns sampled per table.

Behavior notes:

- Snablr prioritizes table names such as `users`, `credentials`, `tokens`, `accounts`, `config`, and `settings`
- Snablr prioritizes column names such as `password`, `secret`, `token`, `api_key`, `connection_string`, and `dsn`
- placeholder-like values stay suppressed
- SQLite findings are reported with a combined path such as `app.db::users.password`
- remote scans never inspect SQLite on the target side; the database file is read and inspected locally

## `suppression`

The `suppression` section controls explicit allowlisting for known-benign findings in live environments.

Example:

```yaml
suppression:
  file: examples/suppressions.production.yaml
  sample_limit: 15
  rules:
    - id: allowlist-payroll-config-review
      description: Suppress reviewed payroll app findings in a known path family.
      reason: Known internal application config reviewed and accepted.
      enabled: true
      shares: [Finance]
      rule_ids: [content.password_assignment_indicators]
      path_prefixes: [Apps/Payroll/]
      path_contains: [internal-payroll]
```

Fields:

- `file`
  Optional external YAML overlay that contributes additional suppression rules.
- `sample_limit`
  Maximum number of suppressed sample findings to include in JSON and HTML summaries.
- `rules`
  Inline suppression rules.

Suppression rule fields:

- `id`
  Required stable identifier used in reports and audit summaries.
- `description`
  Optional operator-facing description.
- `reason`
  Required explanation of why the suppression exists.
- `enabled`
  Enables or disables the rule.
- `hosts`
  Match only findings from specific hosts.
- `shares`
  Match only findings from specific shares.
- `rule_ids`
  Match only findings from specific rule IDs.
- `categories`
  Match only findings from specific categories.
- `exact_paths`
  Match only an exact normalized finding path.
- `path_prefixes`
  Match a normalized finding path subtree.
- `path_contains`
  Match known application or deployment context fragments in the normalized finding path.
- `fingerprints`
  Match exact normalized finding fingerprints for stable cross-run allowlisting.
- `tags`
  Match findings carrying specific tags.

Matching behavior:

- match lists are ORed within a field
- different populated fields are ANDed together
- suppressed findings are hidden from the primary output, but they remain visible in a separate suppression summary
- suppression happens before correlation reporting so known-benign findings do not inflate access-path summaries

## `rules`

Example:

```yaml
rules:
  rules_directory: ""
  fail_on_invalid: false
```

Fields:

- `rules_directory`
  Optional override for rule loading
- `fail_on_invalid`
  Fail startup instead of warning when rule validation fails

If `rules_directory` is empty, Snablr loads:

- `configs/rules/default`
- `configs/rules/custom`

Recommended practice:

- keep shipped defaults in `configs/rules/default`
- keep organization-specific rules in `configs/rules/custom`

## `output`

Example:

```yaml
output:
  output_format: all
  json_out: output/results.json
  html_out: output/report.html
  csv_out: output/findings.csv
  md_out: output/summary.md
  creds_out: output/creds.txt
  scanned_targets_out: output/scanned_targets.txt
  pretty: true
```

Fields:

- `output_format`
  Primary output mode
- `json_out`
  JSON report path
- `html_out`
  HTML report path
- `csv_out`
  Optional CSV sidecar path
- `md_out`
  Optional Markdown sidecar path
- `creds_out`
  Optional curated credential export path. This writes only primary, high-signal findings with usable credential material into a readable `creds.txt`-style file.
- `scanned_targets_out`
  Plain-text target audit path. This writes a stable `scanned_targets.txt`-style file showing which targets were discovered, reachable, and actually scanned.
- `pretty`
  Pretty-print JSON output

Supported `output_format` values:

- `console`
- `json`
- `html`
- `all`

### Output Format Behavior

#### `console`

- prints findings directly to the terminal
- best for live operator feedback

#### `json`

- writes one machine-readable report
- best for automation, scripting, and baseline comparison

#### `html`

- writes one standalone browser report
- best for post-scan triage and remediation review

#### `all`

- combines console, JSON, and HTML
- recommended for most scans

Optional sidecar exports:

- `csv_out`
- `md_out`
- `creds_out`
- `scanned_targets_out`

These can be used together with any primary mode.

## Realistic Example Profiles

### Basic Direct-Target Scan

File:
- `examples/config.basic.yaml`

Use it when:
- you want to scan one known host
- you want JSON and HTML output immediately
- you do not need LDAP discovery

### Domain-Aware Scan

File:
- `examples/config.domain.yaml`

Use it when:
- you want LDAP discovery by default
- you want checkpoints for longer runs
- you want console, JSON, HTML, CSV, and Markdown output together

### Targeted Triage

File:
- `examples/config.targeted.yaml`

Use it when:
- you want to validate a high-value share quickly
- you want to limit work with share/path filters
- you want a narrower triage run instead of a broad environment sweep

### Production Live-Environment Scan

File:
- `examples/config.production.yaml`

Use it when:
- you want the recommended balanced production profile
- you want resumable JSON, HTML, CSV, and Markdown output
- you want a clean suppression overlay for reviewed benign findings
